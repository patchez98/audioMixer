# audioMixer (WIP)
Active audio mixer with powerful headphone amp. Current iteration is for 2 analog inputs, 1 output, but future plans include an integrated USB DAC and microphone feedback.

# Features
- Gain knobs for each channel
- Trimpot for setting max gain (necessary for decent volume control on easy-to-drive headphones)
- Capable of driving 600 ohm headphones, theoretically. Haven't made one yet!
